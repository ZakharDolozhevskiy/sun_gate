##### Getting Started

This project uses [jspm.io](http://jspm.io), a package manager for SystemJS which is built on top
of the dynamic ES6 module loader. This allows developers to load any module format (ES6, CommonJS,
AMD, and globals).

###### Prerequisites

This project assumes that you have NodeJS and any relevant development tools (like XCode) already
installed.
